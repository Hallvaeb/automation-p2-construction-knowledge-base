# kbe-a2 Construction Knowledge Base "Automated Building"

Comprehension story: 
Johanne needs to expand her wealth by going into the building industry. She hires plenty of engineers and architects to design and create the site, and has spent 1/3 of her wealth before construction has even begun!
Sigve, on the other hand, has heard Automated Building and going in with the same amount of wealth still has the same amount when starting to build! "This tool makes planning apartment complexes and building sites easy!". Sigve has the option to add spaces he knows will be in his buildings, and can construct the buildings how he likes or only specify a few spaces on each floor. 
Should Sigve add spaces that don't make any sense, Hallvard the engineer can go in and modify/remove them from the knowledge base.
